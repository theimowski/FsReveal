##Standard approach

###Units tests

--- 

*"Unit tests have been compared with shining a flashlight into a dark room in search of a monster. Shine the light into the room and then into all the scary corners. It doesn't mean the room is monster free - just that the monster isn't standing where you've shined your flashlight."*

*"Unit tests do not prove that a program runs correctly. 
Unit tests may at most tell that the program does not fail in specific cases."*

---

##Issues with standard approach

* Gives little confidence
* *Arrange* (*Fixture*) phase can be overwhelming
